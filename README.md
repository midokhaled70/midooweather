Project Description: Weather Forecasting App
This weather forecasting web application provides a sleek, modern platform for users to stay informed about current weather conditions and forecasts. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the app is highly responsive and offers a smooth user experience across different devices. The primary focus is on displaying real-time weather data for a user-specified location, as well as providing forecasts for the next two days.

The app features a clean, user-friendly interface that allows users to search for weather updates simply by entering the name of a city. It provides detailed information, such as temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, humidity, and more, all with attractive visuals, including weather icons.

Key features include:

Real-Time Weather Data: Displays current weather conditions for a specified city, including temperature (in Celsius), weather description, wind speed, and more.

Forecast for the Next Two Days: Offers detailed weather forecasts for tomorrow and the day after, including maximum and minimum temperatures, weather conditions, and icons representing the forecasted weather.

City Search Functionality: Users can search for weather data by city name. If the city is invalid or the input is empty, an error alert is shown.

Responsive Design: The layout adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

Dynamic Data Updates: Data is fetched from the Weather API and is updated in real-time, providing accurate and current weather information.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks & Libraries: Bootstrap for responsive layout, Font Awesome for icons

Weather Data API: The app uses the WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data and forecasts.

Additional Tools: Custom CSS for styling and interactive elements, JavaScript for dynamic data handling and API requests.
