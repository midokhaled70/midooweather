# Weather Forecasting App

## Project Description:
The **Weather Forecasting App** is a sleek, modern web application designed to keep users informed about current weather conditions and forecasts. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**, ensuring a highly responsive and seamless user experience across a variety of devices. The app focuses on displaying real-time weather data for a user-specified location, as well as providing forecasts for the upcoming two days.

The application features a clean, user-friendly interface where users can easily search for weather updates by entering the name of any city. It displays detailed weather information such as temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, humidity, and more, complemented by visually appealing weather icons.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Displays the current weather conditions for a specified city, including temperature (in Celsius), weather description, wind speed, humidity, and more.
- **Forecast for the Next Two Days**: Offers detailed weather forecasts for tomorrow and the following day, including maximum and minimum temperatures, weather conditions, and icons representing the forecasted weather.
- **City Search Functionality**: Users can search for weather updates by entering a city's name. The app will display weather data for that city, and if the input is invalid or empty, a user-friendly error alert is shown.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Dynamic Data Updates**: Weather data is fetched in real-time from the WeatherAPI, ensuring the information is accurate and up-to-date.

### Technologies Used:
